SUMMARY:

  pam_realm:
    Checks the user name against being of form <user>@<realm>, where <realm> is
    supplied as an argument.  In case the check succeeds, this @<realm> part is
    stripped, and the control is passed to the following module.

OPTIONS:

    debug           -- does not do anytning at the moment
    realm=<realm>   -- specify the <realm> to check against
    allowbare       -- also allows the user name to be of form just <user> without
                       any @<realm>
    nostrip         -- in certain cases, it may be of use to just check if the user
                       name is of proper form

BUGS:

    Huh?
